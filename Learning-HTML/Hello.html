HTML introduces more descriptive 
HTML tags. These include main, header
footer, nav, video, article, section
and others. Makes it easier to read
and optimizes for SEO. The main tag
helps search engines and developers
find the main content of your page.

I can images by using the img element 
and point to a specific src attribute.

E.g.

<img src="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/your-image.jpg">

All images must have an alt attribute. The Text
inside and alt attribute is used for screen readers
to improve accesibility and is displayed if image
fails to load. 

Note: If the image is purely decorative, using
and empty alt attri is best practice.

<img src="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/your-image.jpg" alt="A business cat wearing a necktie.">
